## Important Reminders for Non-Participants

If you are **NOT** in the clash:
- **Keep alliance chat clear** during the clash - we need it for tactical communications
- **DO NOT start digs or boomers** during clash time
- **Help by smashing your help button!** This directly supports our clash participants

## The Basics

We're stronger than our opponent overall, but they have three strong HQ30s that we will need to watch for and react to.

But mostly the same basic strategy as last time:
- Field Hospitals and Military Bases are worth 2x and 3x of water refineries, so those are focus points!
- Canyon Captain is medium value the first time, critical the second time, and meaningless the third time (unless we lose the crystal).
- Crystal is where the hard battle will be fought.

## Squad Assignments & Orders

### Squad-A
*Overbet, Andvl, ZakNaf3in, Demir, Arian*
- **Primary Objective:** Military Base closest to enemy.
- **Captain 1:** Hit their HQs at the captain
- **Captain 2:** Hit the captain (change to their HQ30s if they are hitting our HQs)
- **Crystal:** Be the bad bitches you are and swarm the crystal to bring it home.
- **Captain 3:** Ignore, focus on Military Tents (backup Squad B if they aren't holding their military tent)
- **Special Note:** Overbet, Demir & Zaknaf, you need to keep an eye on their HQ30s and react as best you can to what they are doing. Andvl and Arian, this means you may be on your own for the military base, so work together and really prioritize it and ask for help from Squad B if neeeded.

### Squad-B
*Cheet, Golden, Snoog, Ninja, Jnss*
- **Primary Objective:** Military Base closest our base.
- **Captain 1:** Hit the captain
- **Captain 2:** Hit the captain
- **Crystal:** Escort Duty, kill and cary the crystal as needed, hit their HQs as possible.
- **Captain 3:** Ignore, focus on Military Tents (backup Squad A if they aren't holding their military tent)
  
### Squad-C
*Karma, kulaid, byrelaxx, Melk, Feth*
- **Primary Objective:** Field hospital near our base.
- **Captain 1:** Take as many refineries as we can while they are hitting the captain, don't leave your people in them though. Return to our base after capture.
- **Captain 2:** Hit the captain except Karma who will guard the Field Hospital
- **Crystal:** Escort from our side of the map (don't TP to their side).
- **Captain 3:** Ignore, focus on Field Hospital and nearby refineries.

### Squad-D
*Katniss, Nes, ZakZak, shoepuff, Ginga*
- **Primary Objective:** Field hospital near their base (it'll be intense!)
- **Captain 1:** Hit the captain except ZakZak who should try and hold the FieldHospital if possible (if not, hit the captain too)
- **Captain 2:** Hit the captain
- **Crystal:** If the crystal is on their side of the map, hit the carrier, if the crystal is on our side of the map, hit their HQs
- **Captain 3:** Ignore, focus on their Field Hospital and nearby refineries.
