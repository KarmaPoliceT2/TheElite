The Zombie Horde event is one of the most rewarding events in Last Z: Shooter Run. Here's your complete guide to maximizing your performance.

## Event Overview

- **Duration**: Typically 3 days
- **Goal**: Survive as many waves as possible
- **Rewards**: Scales with waves completed and zombies eliminated

## Recommended Loadout

### Weapons
1. **Primary**: High fire-rate assault rifle (for crowd control)
2. **Secondary**: Shotgun (for close encounters)
3. **Special**: Grenade launcher (for wave 10+)

### Gear
- **Armor**: Focus on durability over damage resistance
- **Boots**: Speed boost recommended for kiting
- **Accessory**: Auto-heal or damage boost

## Wave-by-Wave Strategy

### Waves 1-5: Warm Up
- Conserve special abilities
- Focus on headshots for bonus points
- Collect power-ups immediately

### Waves 6-10: Ramp Up
- Start using special abilities strategically
- Watch for elite zombies (marked in red)
- Keep moving - don't get cornered

### Waves 11+: Survival Mode
- Use all available tools
- Coordinate with teammates if playing co-op
- Focus on staying alive over kill count

## Advanced Tips

- **Positioning**: Always maintain at least two escape routes
