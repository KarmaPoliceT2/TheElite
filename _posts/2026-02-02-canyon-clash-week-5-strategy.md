This week's Canyon Clash takes place in the **Desert Ruins** map - a challenging layout with multiple choke points and verticality. Here's our strategy for dominating this week's clash.

## Map Overview

The Desert Ruins features:
- **3 capture points**: North Tower, Center Plaza, South Bridge
- **High ground advantage**: Multiple elevated positions
- **Limited cover**: Open spaces between objectives

## Opening Strategy (First 2 Minutes)

1. **Split into 3 squads**:
   - Squad A: Rush North Tower (easiest to cap)
   - Squad B: Defend Center Plaza
   - Squad C: Pressure South Bridge

2. **Initial priorities**:
   - Secure North Tower quickly for early points
   - Establish defensive positions at Center Plaza
   - Delay enemy advancement from South Bridge

## Mid-Game Tactics (2-8 Minutes)

### If Winning:
- Hold North Tower and Center Plaza at all costs
- Rotate defenders between points
- Use ranged attackers on high ground

### If Losing:
- Focus all efforts on Center Plaza (highest point value)
- Use flanking routes to avoid main choke points
- Coordinate respawn timing for coordinated pushes

## Key Positions

1. **Sniper Perch** (North Tower, second floor)
   - Controls approach to North Tower
   - Clear sightlines to Center Plaza

2. **Center Fountain** (Center Plaza)
   - Best cover in the map
   - Critical for defending plaza

3. **Bridge Archway** (South Bridge)
   - Natural choke point
   - Easy to defend with AoE abilities

## Recommended Team Composition

- **2 Tanks**: Hold capture points
- **3 DPS**: Pressure enemy positions
- **1 Support**: Heals and buffs for defenders

## Winning Conditions

- **Control Center Plaza**: It's worth double points this week
- **Deny South Bridge**: Prevents enemy respawn advantage
- **Maintain momentum**: Once you have 2 points, don't overextend

## Common Mistakes This Week

- Fighting at South Bridge too early (it's a trap - hard to hold)
- Ignoring high ground positions
- Solo pushing without team support
- Not adapting when strategy isn't working

## This Week's MVP Strategy

Our alliance MVP last week suggested this aggressive variant:
- Rush ALL points immediately with full team
- Overwhelm defenders with numbers
- Once captured, split into defensive positions

Try it out and let us know how it works for you!
