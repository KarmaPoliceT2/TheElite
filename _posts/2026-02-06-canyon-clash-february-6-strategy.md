## Important Reminders for Non-Participants

If you are **NOT** in the clash:
- **Keep alliance chat clear** during the clash - we need it for tactical communications
- **DO NOT start digs or boomers** during clash time
- **Help by smashing your help button!** This directly supports our clash participants

---

## Pre-Clash Checklist (MANDATORY)

1. **Attendance is Critical** - The entire plan depends on you being there. Everyone has specific jobs based on power levels. If you can't make it, **notify leadership ASAP!**

2. **Minimize Capital Clash Losses** - Capital Clash happens a few hours before Canyon Clash. Preserve your troops - Canyon Clash rewards are significantly higher.

3. **Arrive Early** - Be online at least **15 minutes before start time (17:45 Apocalypse Time)**

4. **Recall All Troops** - Recall all troops at least **10 minutes before start**. Turn off auto-join.

5. **Know Your Squad & Role** - We have 4 squads with specific assignments. Read them carefully below.

- **Military Camp** = 3x Water Refinery value
- **These are our primary objectives** - we MUST control them

## Canyon Captain Priority Levels

- **First Appearance (5min)**: Moderate priority
- **Second Appearance (15min)**: HIGHEST priority - sets up the entire match
- **Third Appearance (25min)**: Lowest priority - ignore it completely

### Squad A
